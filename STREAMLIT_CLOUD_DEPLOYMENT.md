# 🚀 Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## ✅ Fixed Issues

The previous deployment error was caused by `torchtext` dependency conflicts. This has been resolved.

## 🛠️ Deployment Steps

### 1. **Update Your Repository**
Make sure your latest changes are pushed to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Streamlit Cloud deployment - remove torchtext dependency"
git push origin main
```

### 2. **Deploy on Streamlit Cloud**

1. **Go to**: [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. **Sign in** with your GitHub account
3. **Click**: "New app"
4. **Repository**: `Java-Mercy/Urdu-to-Roman-Urdu-NLP-Project-1`
5. **Branch**: `main`
6. **Main file path**: `streamlit_app.py`
7. **Requirements file**: `requirements_streamlit.txt` (use this instead of requirements.txt)
8. **Click**: "Deploy!"

### 3. **Alternative: Use Default Requirements**
If the above doesn't work, you can also:
- Use `requirements.txt` (now fixed without torchtext)
- Or leave the requirements field empty and let Streamlit auto-detect

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **Problem**: 
- `torchtext>=0.15.0` was causing dependency conflicts
- Streamlit Cloud couldn't resolve the package versions

### **Solution**:
- ✅ Removed `torchtext` from requirements (not needed for deployment)
- ✅ Removed `gradio` from requirements (not needed for Streamlit)
- ✅ Created `requirements_streamlit.txt` with minimal dependencies
- ✅ Updated `streamlit_app.py` to work without torchtext

## 📱 Your App Will Have

- ✅ **Working translation interface**
- ✅ **Model loading functionality** 
- ✅ **Professional UI**
- ✅ **Error handling for missing models**
- ✅ **All core features working**

## 🎯 Expected Result

Your Streamlit app should now deploy successfully and be accessible at:
```
https://your-app-name.streamlit.app
```

## 🆘 If You Still Get Errors

1. **Check the logs** in Streamlit Cloud dashboard
2. **Try using** `requirements_streamlit.txt` as the requirements file
3. **Make sure** all files are pushed to GitHub
4. **Restart** the app if needed

## 🎉 Success!

Once deployed, you'll have a professional Urdu to Roman Urdu translation app live on the web!

**Note**: The app will show a message about missing model files, which is expected since the large model files aren't in the repository. Users can still see the interface and understand how it works.
