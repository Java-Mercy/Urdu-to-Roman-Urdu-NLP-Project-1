# ðŸš€ How to Get the Model Files

## The Issue
The model files (.pth) are not included in the GitHub repository because they are too large (several GB each). You need to train them yourself.

## âœ… Solution: Train Models in Google Colab

### Step 1: Open the Training Notebook
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload `my-model-final-collab.ipynb` to Colab
3. Or open it directly from GitHub

### Step 2: Run the Training
1. **Run Cell 1**: Install packages
2. **Run Cell 2**: Import libraries  
3. **Run Cell 3**: Dataset setup
4. **Run Cell 4**: Data loading
5. **Run Cell 5**: BPE tokenizer
6. **Run Cell 6**: Model architecture
7. **Run Cell 7**: Dataset and DataLoader
8. **Run Cell 8**: Training class
9. **Run Cell 9**: Main training execution
10. **Run Cell 10**: Experiment system
11. **Run Cell 11**: Helper methods
12. **Run Cell 12**: Run all experiments

### Step 3: Download Model Files
After training completes, you'll have these files:
- `best_model_exp_1.pth` (Small model)
- `best_model_exp_2.pth` (Medium model) 
- `best_model_exp_3.pth` (Large model)

### Step 4: Place Files in Correct Location
1. Download the `.pth` files from Colab
2. Place them in the `models/` directory:
   ```
   models/
   â”œâ”€â”€ best_model_exp_1.pth
   â”œâ”€â”€ best_model_exp_2.pth
   â””â”€â”€ best_model_exp_3.pth
   ```

### Step 5: Run the Apps
Now you can run either:
```bash
# Gradio (Recommended)
python gradio_app.py

# Streamlit
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Training Time
- **Small Model**: ~30 minutes
- **Medium Model**: ~45 minutes  
- **Large Model**: ~60 minutes

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips
1. **Use GPU**: Enable GPU in Colab for faster training
2. **Save to Drive**: Mount Google Drive to save models permanently
3. **Checkpoint**: Models are saved automatically during training

## ðŸ†˜ If You Get Errors
1. Make sure you're using GPU in Colab
2. Check that the dataset is properly loaded
3. Verify all cells ran successfully before training

## ðŸ“± After Getting Models
Your apps will work perfectly and you can:
- Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces (Gradio)
- Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
- Run locally for testing

**The tokenizer files are already included, so you only need the model files!**
